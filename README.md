# DogBreedAI: Dog Breed Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
DogBreedAI is an image classification model built using deep learning techniques to classify dog breeds from images. Using transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model, the model classifies dog breeds with high accuracy.

## Key Technologies:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- VGG16

## Approach:
- Data preprocessing: image resizing, augmentation
- Model development: Transfer learning with VGG16
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## Outcome:
- Delivered a high-performance model for dog breed classification
- Gained hands-on experience with deep learning and computer vision
